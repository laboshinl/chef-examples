# chef-examples

The early examples do use Ubuntu 14.04 to test however you
should get used to writing the recipes distro agnostic because
the distro may change.

### Setup
Set up a basic Chef workstation using Ruby or ChefDK.  Make sure Vagrant, Virtualbox, 
and Berkshelf is installed and working correctly.

The following script might prove useful:
https://github.com/jarosser06/chef_tools_install

Once everything is set up change directory to the first excercise and begin hacking!!

### Help
If you don't know where to begin with an excercise try provisioning the
server first, solve the problem manually, and then create the configuration.

Converge the new server using the following command:
```shell
kitchen converge
```

This will run Chef and handle anything already added to the cookbook
and then leave the box running to allow you to login.

To login to the box use the following command.
```shell
kitchen login
```
